# Project Description
__Objective__:
- Prediction of the winner of an international matches Prediction results are  "Win / Lose / Draw" or "goal difference"
- Apply the model to predict the result of FIFA world cup 2018.

__Data__: Data are assembled from multiple sources, most of them are from Kaggle, others come from FIFA website / EA games.

__Feature Engineering__: To determine who will more likely to win a match, based on my knowledge, I come up with 4 main groups of features as follows:
1. head-to-head match history between 2 teams
2. recent performance of each team (10 recent matches), aka "form"
3. bet-ratio before matches
4. squad strength (from FIFA video game)

Feature list reflects those factors.

## Feature Importance:
![](https://github.com/mrthlinh/FIFA-World-Cup-Prediction/blob/master/pic/feature_importance.png)

From the graph, we can see that among 4 feature groups "head2head","form", "bet odd" and "squad strength", "bet odd" group plays more important role to predict the match results than other feature groups. In "squad strength" feature, "defense aggression", "build up play passing" and "chance creation Shooting" help us determine goal difference better than other features.

### World Cup 2018
Now the model is applying for World Cup 2018 in Russia with __simulation time = 100 000__. While the model didn't perform so well in train/test phase, it has shown stunning results so far, 8 correct results out of 14 matches including matches such as __Portugal - Spain (3-3)__, __Brazil - Switzerland (1-1)__. Here is the result of my model for all matches in Match Day 1 of Group Stage

__Result Explanation:__

Team A vs Team B

- "win_1": A wins with 1 goal differences
- "win_2": A wins with 2 goal differences
- "win_3": A wins with 3 or more goal differences
- "lose_1": B wins with 1 goal differences
- "lose_2": B wins with 2 goal differences
- "lose_3": A wins with 3 or more goal differences
- "draw_0": Draw

__Match Day 1__
